One of the best feelings that I have ever experienced was when I first got a PhD offer. Since the beginning of 2018, I have always envisioned myself to be a top researcher working on a cutting edge research in big labs like Google Deepmind or Facebook AI Research. After I finished my master, I started applying to various PhD openings while also working as a NLP researcher trying to build a portfolio. Out of 12 positions that I had applied, I got accepted into 2 programs and all of them are fully funded (not government-funded this time). Best feelings ever. Who would've thought that a person who once got 1.7 GPA during his bachelor can ever make it to a PhD program. For those of you who are not familiar with the field, PhD program in machine learning is one of the hardest programs to get into. 

I never regarded myself as a smart student. I think I was just lucky. I was lucky enough to get a PhD program because during my master study (master thesis, to be exact), I had the privilege of working with researchers in AI from big labs. I think my recommendation letter was strong and all my master's supervisors were kind enough to vouch for me. How did I get to be able to work with these super talented researchers? I am not sure either. The master thesis selection was pretty hard but somehow I made it. Again, I think I was just lucky. 

Okay, back to the PhD program. I remember I had this discussion with my wife on whether I should just move forward with my PhD. My wife was 7 months pregnant back then and initially she was hesitant. She didn't feel like going abroad is the best decision at that moment for us.

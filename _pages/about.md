50% engineer 50% scientist.

Specialties and interests: natural language processing, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, information retrieval, recommendation systems, data structures, algorithms.

I am a full-stack data scientist currently working at HappyFresh. My interest is currently on the intersection between ML research findings and the engineering side of ML (scalable ML and the best practices of putting ML models in production). I am also experienced in translating business requirements to a working data science product. 

Before I made the switch to do machine learning in the industry, I was working on machine learning on academic setting. I hold a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from University of Amsterdam (UvA) and I was a PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University. Though I am not a full-time researcher anymore, I am still actively following the AI community. I love reading papers from arXiv and occasionally grind on my coding skills as well.

Here you'll find some of my writings about machine learning but also some other rants. 

<!-- My name is Rezka Aufar Leonandya (Rezka). I hold a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from University of Amsterdam (UvA). I am trying to understand intelligence by teaching machine human languages. My long-term research goal is to develop intelligent machines that are capable of learning and communicating with people using natural language. I believe this research area would also teach us something fundamental about how our own intelligent works.

I have considerable experiences in AI research showcased by my publication during my bachelor’s and master’s education. During my time at UvA, I had the privilege to work on my master thesis under supervision of Dr Germán Kruszewski, Dr Elia Bruni, and Dieuwke Hupkes in the i-machine-think research group, a collaboration between University of Amsterdam and Facebook AI Research Paris in which I learned and gained extensive research skills. I am currently working at kata.ai as a Research Scientist to continue my pursuit of understanding intelligence.

My current research interest lies in deep learning and sample-efficient method for natural language processing, including topics such as, but not limited to: compositional semantics, fast language mapping, transfer learning, multi-task learning, semantic parsing, syntactic parsing, interactive dialogue systems, and model-based reinforcement learning. -->
